# simple-DMRG-with-MPS
Basic and simple module to run the density matrix renormalization group algorithm (DMRG) for matrix product states (MPS).

The main file is the [DMRG_Transverse-Ising.ipynb](https://github.com/Qottmann/simple-DMRG-with-MPS/blob/master/DMRG_Transverse-Ising.ipynb) that explains the algorithm and functions in ```DMRG.py```.

This is inspired from TeNPy (https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy)
