# simple-DMRG-with-MPS
Basic and simple module to run the density matrix renormalization group algorithm (DMRG) for matrix product states (MPS).

The main file is the ```Jupyter Notebook``` that explains the algorithm and functions in ```DMRG.py```.

This is heavily inspired but not copied* from TeNPy (https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy)
*except for the exact diagonalization for comparison and testing
