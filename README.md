# simple-DMRG-with-MPS
Basic and simple module to run the density matrix renormalization group algorithm (DMRG) for matrix product states (MPS).

The main file is the Jupyter Notebook that explains the algorithm and functions in ```DMRG.py```.

This is inspired from TeNPy (https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy)
